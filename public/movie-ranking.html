        <p>
            I've never met anyone like Forrest Gump in a movie before, and for that matter I've never seen a movie quite like "Forrest Gump."<br/> Any attempt to describe him will risk making the movie seem more conventional than it is,<br/> but let me try.  It's a comedy, I guess. Or maybe a drama. Or a dream. <br/>
